# Potential improvements Task MCP

- Ensure the processor is added as metadata, and shown in markdown response
- Way to retrieve basis for specific row (by id) or field (by field name)
- Maybe: provide a way to add `limit` of amount of tasks to be done such that we can pass low-token URL with all rows, yet do just x amount of tasks
