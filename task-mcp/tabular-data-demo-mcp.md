# Deep research of tabular data with Parallel, Rube, and Claude

1. tried finding then making sheets using google drive. didn't work but rube proactively came to the rescue: https://claude.ai/chat/b8a93cb4-12f9-45eb-8166-99224301d1b8 . composio was able to execute 4 steps to create a sheet with dummy company data.

2. use composio to read out the sheet, then perform a Parallel Task for each company to find MCP related progress: https://claude.ai/share/226df5ac-620f-4e46-92ee-8689753df65a.

3. After research is done, I asked Rube to put the findings into the sheet in a new column. wow! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YAk2DxXGhNtWeeoAAYwxEYa8i7do3zJUL9IWp20YIj0/edit?usp=sharing
