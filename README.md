# Parallel MCP

This is a colleciton of several MCPs to work with the Parallel APIs

- [Parallel OAuth Provider](parallel-oauth-provider) - Provides MCP-compliant User Authentication into the MCPs (and potentially any other app that uses the Parallel API)
- [Task MCP](task-mcp)
- [Search MCP](search-mcp) - Adds OAuth to original [Parallel Search MCP](https://docs.parallel.ai/features/remote-mcp)
- [Sleep MCP](sleep-mcp) - Experimental tool to allow for longer tool calling time
