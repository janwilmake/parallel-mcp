This is a great idea I think that will unlock lots of productivity.

Can be further extended to also allow for doing multiple tasks (based on a contextual file)

Would need simle oauth provider where the Parallel API key can be provided (and ultimately, needs login with parallel).

When MCP supports async tools and notifications to re-activate a chat with new information, we can also make parallel toolcalls possible. This will be super useful, but not sure how yet!
