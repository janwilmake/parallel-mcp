# JSON-to-JSON MCP

Takes in data, url, or MCP tool-call, and a piece of code, then returns url and shape. Can use dynamic worker loaders for this.

Task MCP Inputs should also allow link (make it clearer if needed)

Ultimate: Large 1MB CSV to CSV over 1 chat completion. Get this to work, then use grokthyself to find candidates for each Parallel position in my active network. Needs ability to retrieve all interactions per person.

# Web Search MCP accesibility

Router that uses a regular model by default but uses websearch or Task MCP if a 1 token prompt jumps to true. Parallel execution

Interesting for:

- adding efficient web-search (with router) to all models
- adding tasks as deep research models
