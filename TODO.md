# Improvements (GOAL: Task Group MCP stable, works with reminder after it's done)

ðŸ¤” **Devtool, no-coder target audience, or both?** - Determine what the target user is: developer building an app with parallel (devtool) or no-coder that doesn't know anything about the tasks? The latter needs better guardrails and a simpler API with less control.

- âœ… Put login provider at `oauth.parallel.ai` for better trust
- âœ… Remove de-emphasize chatgpt from docs. make it a group table with 2 mcps
- âœ… Get merged: https://github.com/shapleyai/documentation/pull/221

# Improve MCP

- âœ… Ensure the processor is added as metadata, and all metadata is shown in markdown response
- âœ… For the result markdown tool, add a way to retrieve the basis too, below the table, as JSON: optional parameter `basis?:"index:{number}"|"field:{string}"|"all"` for specific row (by index) or field (by field name) or all basis content. Ensure that when the table is shown, it shows the index as first column before status.
- âœ… make parameter output work as the openapi suggests
- âœ… Make output description task spec aware
- âœ… Make processor description pricing aware
- âœ… Add description for inputs to be cautious adding too many inputs at once unless the user explicitnly says all

# Testing & Demos

Goal: getting hands dirty, lots of experimentation. Test more, uncover failure modes, fix these.

Think about:

- which MCP client
- which data source / data destination
- authentic use cases

<!-- It's demo time. The thing fucking works! Ideally I make highly authentic demos that show the benefit and experimental process. This is a testing ground. The ones that get engagement can be turned into professional blogs with more enterprise use-case -->

- vscode demo: new!

- **ChatGPT Demo**: user uploads CSV and says what we need to add, and instructions on repeating with first 5 until quality is good. Task Group API is used repeatedly. Finally, perform batch API on all rows. Download final CSV.

- **Subagent (Claude Code or Cursor)** - Put this MCP in a subagent template. The process is always to use search first to make a list, then do a Parallel Task, then use the Alarm MCP (or just `sleep 900`), and get back with final results https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents#available-tools. This can be added as description to the agent context. The input can come from a JSON file, the outputs can be written to a JSON files as well. Ideally we perform an experiment of choosing processors here: it can be an example of an experiemnt where we compare chaining tasks with doing one bigger task.

- **CRM (Attio) input**. First, get the people that I follow on X into a CRM. Ask to enrich my people with social media based on logical proof, put back a summary into CRM.

- **Claude Demo**: use Parallel Search to find all MCP directories. Then determine an SEO strategy for each via a task. Output is a small actionable list of tasks.

**Authentic Use cases:**

- Based People: task chaining: how to more effectively prototype different strategies?!
- Get personal X network into CRM, then research them more (find other owned socials, find company, etc)
- Make agent-friendly forward thinking assessment score for any company. KYB: derisk the future!
