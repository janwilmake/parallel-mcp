- **Enrich datapoint for high number of items** - use Parallel Search to find all MCP directories. Then determine an SEO strategy for each via a task. Output is a small actionable list of tasks.
- **Person Enrichment** - First, get the people that I follow on X into a CRM. Ask to enrich my people with social media based on logical proof, put back a summary into CRM.
  - Entity Resolution (other channels)
  - Find complete picture of sources of a person
  - KYC
- KYB (know your business) deep research (over MCP?) - Make agent-friendly forward thinking assessment score for any company. KYB: derisk the future!
- Example of chaining tasks
- Product matching / Price comparison
- **Based People**: task chaining: how to more effectively prototype different strategies?!

**Recruitment/headhunting**: Fill one Parallel role using my network (Blog Idea)

1. Who do I know that could fill this role: {role info} —> X Interactions MCP
2. Find 20 candidates, do background check on each using entity resolution and then a follow up research on verified highly confident sources
3. Finally, make a verdict on the best 3 candidates to approach and why
