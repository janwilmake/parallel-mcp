# Search MCP everywhere using oauth provider

- âœ… Put oauth provider at https://parallel.simplerauth.com (central is good since it will be swapped by one with internal connection)
- 2. Search MCP proxy server (https://search-mcp.parallel.ai) that proxies `/mcp` to https://mcp.parallel.ai/v1beta/search_mcp and adds minimally needed additions to make it work with oauth. CAREFULLY test and document these additions!
- 3. Add to smithery. This is easy.
- 4. Use oauth provider from login.parallel.ai instead for `multitask-demo`

It'd be great to also start with a simple CLI `parallel` that can do tasks from a markdown spec.

# Alarm MCP

Test this MCP in cursor, claude code, and others, and see what the limitations are and if they can be raised.

# Parallel combined MCP

- Search
- Task group with md-retrieval
- Alarm-MCP with notification-ping to stay alive
- Put this MCP in a subagent template. The process is always to use search first to make a list, then do a Parallel Task, then use the Alarm MCP (or just `sleep 900`), and get back with final results https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents#available-tools. This can be added as description to the agent context.
