<!-- Clear focus on getting MCP-UI post out there and making currently available features easier to use -->

# TODAY

✅ improve task mcp docs

✅ write programmatic-use docs

✅ Explain what you can build with this (An authenticated agent that can perform tasks and analyze results), or an agent that can do generic research.

- OpenAI https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp?lang=javascript
- Anthropic https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector
- AI SDK https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/mcp-tools https://ai-sdk.dev/cookbook/node/mcp-tools https://vercel.com/blog/generate-static-ai-sdk-tools-from-mcp-servers-with-mcp-to-ai-sdk

✅ Use new docs context, improve blogpost with that without obsessing over detail, ensure to keep separation of the goal - blog is for convincing that it's good.

- one first enterprise-grade async MCPs
- the most work done in a single tool call

🟠 Make video demo and maybe visuals like gif for blog

After docs are merged:

- ✅ contact listings approved that have impact when featured
- keep dogfooding and collecting feedback
- reach out to partners to co-market mcp

Position MCP getting started as 'the easiest way to get started with parallel APIs' and communicate this clearly with team.

# Examples

Dogfood More

<!-- Put examples in thread https://wilmake.slack.com/archives/C09807JBB26/p1760031061625639 -->

- **Enrich datapoint for high number of items** - use Parallel Search to find all MCP directories. Then determine an SEO strategy for each via a task. Output is a small actionable list of tasks.
- **Person Enrichment** - First, get the people that I follow on X into a CRM. Ask to enrich my people with social media based on logical proof, put back a summary into CRM.
  - Entity Resolution (other channels)
  - Find complete picture of sources of a person
  - KYC
- KYB (know your business) deep research (over MCP?) - Make agent-friendly forward thinking assessment score for any company. KYB: derisk the future!
- Example of chaining tasks
- Product matching / Price comparison
- **Based People**: task chaining: how to more effectively prototype different strategies?!
- thefacebook.university --> person analysis for everyone at your company, making a directory of people in your slack by finding stuff about them on the internet

**Recruitment/headhunting**: Fill one Parallel role using my network (Blog Idea)

1. Who do I know that could fill this role: {role info} —> Clonechat MCP
2. Find 20 candidates, do background check on each using entity resolution and then a follow up research on verified highly confident sources
3. Finally, make a verdict on the best 3 candidates to approach and why
