# Adapt simplerauth-client

Must have the same workings as parallel-provider. Test it actually works everywhere including cursor/vscode.

Use simplerauth in `multitask-demo` and test again for it to work everywhere!!!

# Alarm MCP

Test this MCP in cursor, claude code, and others, and see what the limitations are and if they can be raised.

# Parallel combined MCP

- Search
- Task group with md-retrieval
- Alarm-MCP with notification-ping to stay alive
- Put this MCP in a subagent template. The process is always to use search first to make a list, then do a Parallel Task, then use the Alarm MCP (or just `sleep 900`), and get back with final results https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents#available-tools. This can be added as description to the agent context.
