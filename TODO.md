# QOL

- ✅ For failed tasks, we need the reason in the markdown!
- ✅ Check how streaming works. Ideally we just want to stream the task group and fetch immediately when a result is in.
- Ensure total tasks and status in markdown are accurate
- Show confidence as emoji in markdown
- Figure out how to make it loose no functionality that doesn't increase complexity: https://letmeprompt.com/rules-httpsuithu-jza7uv0

# Improving HTML

For now it's not a priority.

- Add confidence and references into HTML
- Improve HTML and streaming behavior to be fully realtime
- Make HTML mobile-friendly
- Add ability to see in the title whether the task result is still loading or not (Good DX)
